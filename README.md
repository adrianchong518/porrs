# PORRS

It is [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth), but re-implemented in [Rust]([https://rust-](https://www.rust-lang.org)).

With no experience in language / compiler development, this is only a hobby project
and learning experience. Do not expect anything great out of this.

## Acknowledgement

Thank Alexey Kutepov, i.e. Tsoding for creating the language `Porth` and his
[YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4)
for inspiring me to attempt this.
